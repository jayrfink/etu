README File for etu 

ABOUT
-----
ETU or the Enlightenment Thumbnailing Utility utilizes imliob2.

See INSTALL file to build and install.

USAGE
-----

Etu can be used one of four ways:

	- rescale a single image
	- check to see if a single image needs to be re-scaled (disk cache)
	- rescale an entire directory 
	- check files in a directory to see if they need to be re-scaled (disk
		cache)

EXAMPLES
--------

Scale a single png image to 80x80 pixels with 60% quality, rename it 
to outfile.png

	etu -i filename.png -w 80 -h 80 -q 60  -o outfile.png

Simply repeat the command to see if outfile.png needs updated.

Scale a directory of images called my-images/ and send them to thumb-images/,
change them to 100x100 px with as little loss as possible:

	etu --src /path/to/my-images/ -d thumb-images -w 100 -h 100 -q 100 

Rerun to refresh.
